<p>Hi! I am Florianne and I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>I am passionate about solving complex problems in society and business using (digital) data and computational methods. My current research offers a computational perspective on the reproduction of socio-economic inequalities by parental status and gender.</p>
