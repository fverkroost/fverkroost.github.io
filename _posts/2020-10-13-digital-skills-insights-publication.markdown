A new article, co-authored with Ridhi Kashyap, Kiran Garimella, Ingmar Weber and Emilio Zagheni, has now been published in the 
ITU Digital Skills Insights 2020 report. In this article, we explore global gender gaps in information technology (IT), 
leveraging novel and aggregate data on user counts from LinkedIn, the world's largest professional networking platform. 
We show how men generally outnumber women in the IT sector on the platform. Gender gaps are largest in low and lower-middle 
income countries, and in IT subdomains focused towards computer programming rather than communications and services.
Our chapter can be found [here](https://fverkroost.github.io/assets/Verkroost-Kashyap-Garimella-Weber-Zagheni-Tracking-global-gender-gaps-in-information-technology-using-online-data.pdf); the full report is published [here](https://academy.itu.int/sites/default/files/media2/file/Digital%20Skills%20Insights%202020.pdf).
