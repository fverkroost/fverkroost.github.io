At the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic is keeping the world in its grip. 
Loads of numbers and statistics are popping up on the Internet, and with these numbers changing increasingly fast, 
it is hard to keep up to date on the most recent official statistics. Therefore, I decided to make this a bit easier and 
develop a Shiny dashboard to display the latest accurate numbers for the United Kingdom from official data from Public Health England.

The dashboard contains several different plots. The first one shows a timeline of total and new cases as well as deaths in the 
United Kingdom. The second and third tabs show the total number of cases across England by region respectively county.
The fourth and final tab shows a timeline of total cases by country (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). 

Check out the dashboard [here](https://fverkroost.shinyapps.io/COVID19intheUnitedKingdom/)!
